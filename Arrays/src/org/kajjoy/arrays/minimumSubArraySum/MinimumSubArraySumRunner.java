/**
 * Created by dipayan on 9/11/16.
 *
 * Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

 For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7, the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length of 2 under the problem constraint.
